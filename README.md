## Description

This script demonstrates the linear search algorithm in Python. Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a simple algorithm that iterates through each element of a list sequentially until it finds a match for the target value. The script defines a `linear_search` function that performs this search operation.

## Usage

To use this script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Copy the code from the script and run it using a Python interpreter.

```bash
python linear_search_example.py

# Example

The script includes an example usage of the linear_search function. It searches for a target value within a sample list and prints whether the target was found and at which index.

# Example usage:
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target_value = 5

result = linear_search(my_list, target_value)

if result != -1:
    print(f"Target {target_value} found at index {result}")
else:
    print(f"Target {target_value} not found in the list")

# Function Details

linear_search(arr, target)
Perform linear search to find the target in the given list.

# Parameters:
arr (list): The list to search.
target: The value to find.

# Returns:

int: The index of the target if found, or -1 if not found.
